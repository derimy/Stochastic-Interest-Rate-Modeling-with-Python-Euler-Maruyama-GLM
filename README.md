# 📊 Stochastic Interest Rate Modeling with Python

This project presents a stochastic modeling approach to interest rates using Python, based on real U.S. Treasury data (DGS10 – 10-Year Yield). It combines numerical simulation, statistical calibration, and visual analysis for financial modeling.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Simulate interest rate dynamics using Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)
- Apply the **Euler-Maruyama** method for numerical approximation
- Calibrate the model using **Generalized Linear Models (GLM)**
- Visualize results through **joy plots**, time series graphs, and backtesting

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [FRED – U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield (DGS10)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10)
- Daily time series of government bond yields
